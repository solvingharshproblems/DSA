//Tree is hierarchical data structure which is a collection of nodes connected by edges.
//The topmost node is called root node.
//Each node contains a value and a list of references to its child nodes.
//A node that has no children is called a leaf node.
//A subtree of a node is a tree consisting of that node and its descendants.
//For a particular node, the parent node is called the ancestor node and the child nodes are called descendant nodes.
//There are mainly 5 types of binary trees:
//1. Full Binary Tree: A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
//2. Complete Binary Tree: A binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
//3. Perfect Binary Tree: A binary tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
//4. Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree in which the height of the tree can maximum be log(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
//5. Degenerate (or pathological) Tree: A binary tree in which each parent node has only one child. This essentially makes it a linked list.
